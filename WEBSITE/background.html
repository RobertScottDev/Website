        <p> My career is just getting started. I grew up in a poor family living in downtown Cleveland. While i never looked at my sitituation as a setback, I did notice the differecnce of people in better situation. My parents wanted to make sure i didnt turn into another statistic, so they tried they're hardest to keep me in Charter schools hoping it would be a positive impact. I bounced around schools my whole life until i landed in Horizon Science Academy from 8<sup>th</sup> grade till i graduated. I had knoe idea what i wanted to do, but eventually i decide to become a software developer and never lok back </p>
