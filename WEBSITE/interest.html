        <h2>Video Games</h2>

The numbeers game that come into play when trying to count the frames you have to do a combo always excite me. The fighting games im playing rignt now are Dragon Ball Fighterz, Injustice 2 and soon Mortal Kombat 11. I stream on twitch:RobertSensei </p>
        <h3>Books</h3>
        <p>Books have played a veryh special part of my life. From the Da Vinci Code to The Alchemist, books are important to me. Theres nothing i find more relaxing then sitting outside on a nice day and catch up on some of my reading</p>
